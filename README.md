Measure Stress
==============

The project title is:

> Using machine learning to investigate sympathetic activation of the autonomic
> nervous system (SAANS) during the treatment of mild traumatic brain injury,
> chronic pain, and post-traumatic stress disorder.


Summary
-------

The goal of this research is to further our understanding and clinical
management of Canadian Forces service members and veterans suffering from a
complex medical triad of traumatic brain injury, chronic pain, and
post-traumatic stress disorder. Over half of rehabilitation patients experience
one or more of these complex medical conditions, often associated with
intractable symptoms which do not respond to traditional treatment options, and
impairing their ability to function effectively at work and in the community.
Using a Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment (CAREN) this research will
collect and consolidate a series of non-invasive whole- body biological
measurements from patients during immersive therapy sessions in the CAREN
Virtual Reality facility. High-performance computing and machine learning will
be used to develop and deploy real-time estimators of SAANS. These systems will
allow clinicians to create individualized treatment plans for patients, thereby
maximizing rehabilitation benefits and avoiding costly setbacks in patient
treatment.

Repository Structure
--------------------

The 'boot' directory contains the boot scripts to configure cloud compute
resources from a bare Ubuntu 18.04 installation, to a functional appliance.

The 'www' directory contains the website which will be hosted on the
public/internet facing side of the cloud environment. These pages will be
publicly accessible. Pages should redirect to https for secure (SSL)
connections. Private research group information should be password protected.
