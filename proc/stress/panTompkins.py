This function implements the Pan-Tomkins ECG QRS detection algorithm
as described in:

Pan, Jiapu, and Willis J. Tompkins. "A real-time QRS detection algorithm."
IEEE transactions on biomedical engineering 3 (1985): 230-236.

The algorithm utilizes filtering, adaptive thresholding, and criteria based on
human cardiac physiology to detect QRS complexes in the face of noise and quickly
changing and diverse ECG morphologies. This function implements the Pan-Tompkins
algorithm as it was originally published, along with two modifications which
include additional filtering and eliminating potential QRS detections that occur
within the refractory period. Since this algorithm is often used to find R-peak
locations (and not just general QRS detection) for applications such as Heart
Rate Variability (HRV) analysis, this function also performs a neighborhood search
around the final QRS detection locations to find exact R-peak locations.
A summary of the algorithm is described below:

(1) Band Pass Filtering

    The ECG signal is first bandpassed filtered between 5 and 15 Hz to eliminate
    noise due to muscle contractions, 60 Hz noise, baseline wander, and T-wave
    interference. As implemented in the Pan-Tompkins publication, a low and
    high pass filter are applied in series to acheive a frequency passband between
    5 and 12 Hz.

    LP ---> y(nT) = 2y(nT-T) - y(nT-2T) + x(nT) - 2x(nT - 6) + x(nT-12T)

    HP ---> y(nT) = 32x(nT - 16T) - [y(nT - T) + x(nT) - x(nT - 32T)]

    This code also applies an additional 5th order Butterworth filter with
    cutoff frequencies of 5 and 15 Hz to make this algorithm robust to noisier
    data sets.

(2) Derivative

    QRS slope information is computed via differentiation of the filtered ECG
    signal.

           y(nT) = (1/8T)[-x(nT-2T) - 2x(nT - T) + 2x(nT +T) + x(nT + 2T)]

(3) Squaring Function

    The squaring function serves for non-linear amplification the high frequency
    components of the derivative signal associated with the QRS complexes.

                             y(nT) = [x(nT)] ** 2

(4) Moving Integration Waveform

    A final waveform is created using a moving-window integrator. This waveform
    serves to obtain waveform feature information, with each rising edge
    corresponding to the location of the QRS complex (increased amplitude --> increased
    area)

           y(nT) = (1/N)[x(nT - (N - 1)T + x(nT - (N - 2)T) + ... + x(nT)]

    The width of the waveform was found empiracally in the publication to be
    30 samples wide for a sample frequency of 200 Hz. In order to increase
    the flexibility of this algorithm to signals sampled at different
    frequencies, the window width is automatically adjusted so that the window
    is approximately 150 ms wide regardless of sampling frequency.

(5) Fudicial Mark

    The rising edge of the integration waveform corresponds with the QRS complex.
    A fudicial mark indicating the temporal location of the QRS complex is made by
    locating the peaks of the integration waveform associated with the R peak of
    the QRS complex. This is done through differentiation, zero-crossing location,
    and moving average amplitude thresholding to eliminate peaks from the P and T
    wave features.

(6) Adjusting Signal and Noise Thresholds

     Following a brief two second initilization phase, two sets of signal and noise
     thresholds are adjustedfor both the integration waveform and the filtered ECG
     signal, respectively. These thresholds are based off previous peaks determined
     to be either signal peaks or noise peaks. Thresholds are able to adapt quickly to
     rapidly changing heart rates by keeping running estimates of both signal and
     noise levels from previous peak assignments. Thresholds are computed as follows
     for both the integration waveform and the filtered ECG:

     If signal peak  ---> SPK = 0.125 * Peak_Amplitude + 0.875 * SPK
     If noise peak   ---> NPK = 0.125 * Peak_Amplitude + 0.875 * NKP

                          THRESHOLD1 = NPK + 0.25 * (SPK - NPK)
                          THRESHOLD2 = 0.5 * THRESHOLD1

     A peak is considered to be a signal peak if it exceeds THRESHOLD1 or
     exceeds THRESHOLD2 if a searchback is triggered.

(6) RR Rate Limits

    Two heartbeats are needed to establish the average RR interval and rate
    limits. If any of the eight most recent sequential beats fall outside the the
    accepted low and high RR-interval limits, heart rate is considered to be
    irregular and the signal and noise thresholds are reduced by half in order to
    increase sensitivity.

(6) Searchback

    If a QRS complex is not found within 166% of the average of the previous
    eight beats during normal sinus rhythm, it is assumed that a QRS complex
    has been missed. A searchback process is then triggered, which finds
    the maximal peak within the current signal and noise thresholds to be
    a QRS complex candidate. If this QRS complex candidate exceeds THRESHOLD2,
    the signal levels will take more consideration of the current peak
    amplitude and less on the previous signal values via the following modification
    to the signal level running estimate:

                    SPK = 0.25 * Peak_Amplitude + 0.75 * SPKI

(7) T-wave Identification

    Once a QRS complex is identified, there is a 200 ms refractory in which it is
    physiologically impossible for another beat to occur, thus allowing for the
    elimination of any QRS detection during this time frame. If a QRS is detected
    after the refractory period but before 360 ms after the temporal location
    of the previous QRS detection, we must decide whether this peak is an actual
    QRS complex or a T-wave. If the slope of this peak is less than half of the
    slope of the previous QRS, it is identified as a T-wave.

(8) Detection

    A QRS is identified if it is identified in both the band-passed filtered ECG signal
    and in the integration waveform.

(9) Neighborhood Search

    A neighborhood search with a search window of 0.2 seconds is used to find the
    highest amplitude point in the general vicinity of the QRS complex. This is
    the location of the R-peak.
